# Face Keypoint Detection


1.main.py:
Code for part 1 and part 2

2.part3.ipynb/part3.py:
Code for part 3 and part 5 (Kaggle submission) and its converted python file

3.part4.ipynb/part4.py:
Code for part 4 and its converted python file

4.auto_face_morphing.py:
Code for Bells and Whistles: load the model in part 3 locally and integrate it with code in project 3 to generate face morphing gif automatically

Instructions:
For part 1, part 2 and Bells and Whistles, you can 1. create a folder named results and a folder named gif inside the results to store the outputs 
2. Download the database form the web and 3. run each python file locally to generate the outputs.

For part 3 and part 4, since I worked on colab and the python files for them are not well-documented, you should open each notebook on colab and 
run each cell from top to the bottom to get the results. In addition, since I get training database by mounting Google Drive, you may also upload
the zip file for database to the Google Drive used for these parts.
